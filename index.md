# Welcome
In my pursuit to stay hands on with tech, I've embarked on a blogging journey. This endeavor isn't just to keep myself informed, but also to sharpen my skills in simplifying and articulating complex concepts in both written and spoken forms.

For the non-technical reader, I'll distill each topic into plain English, enliven it with visualisations, and draw upon mindful analogies for clearer understanding.

Each topic will further delve into 3 parts:

- **Boardroom**: Key insights for the non-technical reader,
- **Engine room**: Essential knowledge for engineers,
- **Prod**: Bring it to life by detailing how I implemented the technology in crafting a golf app.
